# Job-search-board

This board allows a user to register and start saving vacancy information like url, vacant position, job description, requirements, etc. in
a database (PostgreSQL hosted on AWS RDS). A user can add application information to every vacancy in order to track resumes versions they
submitted as well as cover letters. You can access the Job search board at https://job-search.kadraliev.com.

If you have any questions or comments, please let me know via a form on my website: www.kadraliev.com.
